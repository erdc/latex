		 LaTeX Support for Microsoft Georgia
	       and ITC Franklin Gothic In Text and Math
			     Version 0.4

This package provides LaTeX support for Microsoft Georgia and ITC
Franklin Gothic fonts, supplied, for example, with Microsoft Windows.
The package provides  support for text and math.

The math support is very preliminary: there is a lot of work to do on
individual kerning and glyph placement!
